# [Zig tokenizer updated to use labeled switch statements]($section.id('2024-09-11'))

Author: Andrew Kelley

Now that Matthew landed [labeled switch continue syntax](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/21257), it's time
to start using it.

[Eric Petersen swooped in for a first-time contribution](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/21367),
updating Zig's tokenizer to use the new syntax, measuring a 13% wall time
performance increase for the `zig ast-check` command:

This line of code tickles me:

```zig
state: switch (State.start) {
```
